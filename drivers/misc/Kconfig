config MVEBU_MBUS
	bool "MBUS address decoding driver"
	depends on !MVEBU_SPL_DDR_OVER_PCI_SUPPORT
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to add support
	  for MBUS address decoding driver.
	  This driver initialize the MBUS windows
	  only.

config MVEBU_MBUS_SPL_ONLY
	bool "MBUS address decoding driver in SPL only"
	depends on MVEBU_MBUS
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to do MBUS windows
	  modifications in SPL executable only
	  In regular u-boot image MBUS driver will
	  only read memory windows information from DT

config MVEBU_MBUS_SKIP_DRAM_WIN
	bool "skip DRAM window configuration in MBUS driver"
	depends on MVEBU_MBUS
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to skip DRAM window
	  configuration in MBUS driver.
	  For some Soc, DRAM MBUS window has to
	  be at the beginning, and could not be
	  configured by anyway (keep the default value).

config MVEBU_PHY_INDIRECT
	bool "Access to PHY indirect registers"
	depends on TARGET_ARMADA_8K
	default y
	help
	  Choose this option to add support
	  for PHY indirect access.
	  This driver initialize the IHB window.

config MVEBU_ICU
	bool "Interrupt Consolidation Unit (ICU) driver"
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to add support
	  for Interrupt consolidation unit.
	  This driver sets up the mapping between CP-110
	  interrupts and AP GIC interrupts.

config MVEBU_CHIP_SAR
	bool "Chip sample at reset support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for chip level sample at reset
	  retreval functions.
	  These functions are used by various U-Boot drivers
	  and subsystem to discover the SoC sample at reset
	  configuration.

config MVEBU_SPL_CHIP_SAR_DUMP
	bool "Sample at reset dump (in SPL)"
	depends on SPL && MVEBU_CHIP_SAR
	default n
	help
	  To add this option you need to add it to the spl config
	  Choose this option to dump sample at
	  reset registers
