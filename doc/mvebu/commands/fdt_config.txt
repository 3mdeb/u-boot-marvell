fdt_config command:
====================
Dynamic board configurations handled by using a set of pre-defined SoC/Board configurations.
This command allows the user to select which configurations to boot with.
In addition, this command gives us the ability to edit the FDT using FDT generic command of U-Boot,
and save it to EEPROM.

notes:
------
1. To enable/disable the option to read FDT from EEPROM set fdt_config to on/off accordingly.
2. In order to use "fdt_config read" or "fdt_config select" run the "fdt_config list" command before,
   the <option_id> available are received from this list.
3. All changes will be relevant only after running the save command ("fdt_config save") and reset the board.
4. The list of all the available configurations is located under "doc/mvebu/a8k/board_options"
5. This feature reads configuration from eeprom, so before running it for the first time,
   please erase eeprom to avoid any garbage data with command "i2c mw.l 0x57 0.2 0 0x200".
   Please be noted:
   a) In I2C erase command, 0x57 is the eeprom address for A3700 DB, for other boards it would be different,
      please check the board Spec.
   b) Erase eeprom is a temporary work around, when this feature is mature enough to handle the garbage data
      in eeprom, it would not be necessary.

"fdt_config on" -   enable the option to read Device Tree from eeprom at boot time.

"fdt_config off" -  disable the option to read Device Tree from eeprom at boot time.

"fdt_config list" - show all Device Tree that are suitable to the board.
                    print the list of <option_id> and fdt name for all the suitable FDT.

"fdt_config read flash <option_id>"
		  - read the <option_id> from user, and save the relevant Device Tree to DRAM using address 'fdt_addr' environment variable
		    as default.
		  example:
			$ fdt_config read flash 3
			**read the FDT with from flash (u-boot image) with id=3 and save it to DRAM.
			**note: in order to read fdt from flash, run the "fdt_config list" command before.
			        the <option_id> available are received from this list.
"fdt_config read eeprom"
		  - read Device Tree from EEPROM and save it to DRAM using address 'fdt_addr' environment variable
		    as default.
		  example:
			$ fdt_config read eeprom

"fdt_config select <option_id>"
		  - select Device Tree from flash to loading in bootloader at the next time.
		    If the user want to use this option its necessary to disable read FDT from EEPROM (by runnig "fdt_config off").
		    **note: to select fdt from flash needed to run "fdt_config list" command before.
			    because the option_id received from this list.

"fdt_config save" - write Device Tree changes from RAM to EEPROM.

example:
------
   i) Choose one of dtb files in u-boot image to boot with.
      a) List all the dtb files in u-boot image.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config list
	 FDT config list:
	 1 - DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular
	 2 - DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular-SGMII1
      b) Choose one dtb to boot with for next time.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config select 2
	 To save the changes, please run the command fdt_config save.
      c) Save the configuration.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config save
      d) Reset, then u-boot would start with the dtb file selected.
	 Marvell>> reset
   ii) Load certain dtb file from u-boot image into dram, modify it,
       then burn it into eeprom and boot with it.
      a) Turn on boot with dtb in eeprom feature.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config on
	 Do you want to read FDT from EEPROM? <y/N> y
	 Load fdt from EEprom
	 To save the changes, please run the command fdt_config save.
      b) List all the dtb files in u-boot image.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config list
	 FDT config list:
	 1 - DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular
	 2 - DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular-SGMII1
      c) Load dtb file into dram.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config read flash 2
	 To save the changes, please run the command fdt_config save.
      d) Run "fdt print" command to see the entire dtb file in dram.
      e) Edit any property, for example, preset value in A3700 dts file.
         Following is all the valid values for property "preset":
	 PRESET_CPU_600_DDR_600:  0
	 PRESET_CPU_400_DDR_600:  1
	 PRESET_CPU_1000_DDR_800: 2
	 PRESET_CPU_800_DDR_800:  3

	 Marvell>> fdt set /soc/freq preset "<1>"
      f) Save the dtb file into eeprom.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config save
      g) Reset, then u-boot would start with the dtb file in eeprom.
	 Marvell>> reset
