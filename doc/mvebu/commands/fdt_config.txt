fdt_config command:
====================
Dynamic board configurations handled by using a set of pre-defined SoC/Board configurations.
This command allows the user to select which configurations to boot with.
In addition, this command gives us the ability to edit the FDT using FDT generic command of U-Boot,
and save it to EEPROM.

notes:
------
1. To enable/disable the option to read FDT from EEPROM set fdt_config to on/off accordingly.
2. In order to use "fdt_config read" or "fdt_config select" run the "fdt_config list" command before,
   the <option_id> available are received from this list.
3. All changes will be relevant only after running the save command ("fdt_config save") and reset the board.
4. The list of all the available configurations is located under "doc/mvebu/a8k/board_options"


"fdt_config on" -   enable the option to read Device Tree from eeprom at boot time.

"fdt_config off" -  disable the option to read Device Tree from eeprom at boot time.

"fdt_config list" - show all Device Tree that are suitable to the board.
                    print the list of <option_id> and fdt name for all the suitable FDT.

"fdt_config read flash <option_id>"
		  - read the <option_id> from user, and save the relevant Device Tree to DRAM using address 'fdt_addr' environment variable
		    as default.
		  example:
			$ fdt_config read flash 3
			**read the FDT with from flash (u-boot image) with id=3 and save it to DRAM.
			**note: in order to read fdt from flash, run the "fdt_config list" command before.
			        the <option_id> available are received from this list.
"fdt_config read eeprom"
		  - read Device Tree from EEPROM and save it to DRAM using address 'fdt_addr' environment variable
		    as default.
		  example:
			$ fdt_config read eeprom

"fdt_config select <option_id>"
		  - select Device Tree from flash to loading in bootloader at the next time.
		    If the user want to use this option its necessary to disable read FDT from EEPROM (by runnig "fdt_config off").
		    **note: to select fdt from flash needed to run "fdt_config list" command before.
			    because the option_id received from this list.

"fdt_config save" - write Device Tree changes from RAM to EEPROM.
