Notes:
------
- fdt_config commands are only relevant for Marvell boards that used the EEPROM device.

fdt_config command:
====================
Dynamic board configurations are handled by using a set of pre-defined SoC/board configurations.
This command allows the user to select which configurations to boot with.
In addition, this command gives us the ability to edit the FDT using the FDT generic command of U-Boot,
and save it to EEPROM.

Notes:
------
1. To enable/disable the option to read FDT from the EEPROM set fdt_config to on/off accordingly.
2. In order to use "fdt_config read" or "fdt_config select" first run the "fdt_config list" command.
   The available <option_ids> are received from this list.
3. All changes will be relevant only after running the save command ("fdt_config save") and resetting the board.
4. The list of all the available configurations is located under "doc/mvebu/a8k/board_options"
5. This feature reads the configuration from EEPROM, so before running it for the first time,
   please erase EEPROM with command "i2c mw.l 0x57 0.2 0 0x200" to delete garbage data..
   Please note:
   a) In the I2C erase command, 0x57 is the EEPROM address for A3700 DB; for other boards it would be different.
      Check the board spec for details.
   b) Erasing EEPROM is a temporary workaround. When this feature is more mature, it will handle the the garbage data
      in the EEPROM and so erasing will not be necessary.

"fdt_config on" -   Enable the option to read the device tree from EEPROM at boot time.

"fdt_config off" -  Disable the option to read the device tree from EEPROM at boot time.

"fdt_config list" - Show the part of the device tree suitable for this board.
                    print the list of <option_id> and fdt name for all the suitable FDTs.

"fdt_config read flash <option_id>"
		  - Read the <option_id> from user, and save the relevant device tree to DRAM using address 'fdt_addr' environment variable
		    as default.
		  Example:
			$ fdt_config read flash 3
			**Read the FDT with from flash (U-Boot image) with id=3 and save it to DRAM.
			**Note: In order to read fdt from flash, run the "fdt_config list" command before.
			        the <option_id> available are received from this list.
"fdt_config read eeprom"
		  - Read the device tree from the EEPROM and save it to DRAM using address 'fdt_addr' environment variable
		    as default.
		  Example:
			$ fdt_config read eeprom

"fdt_config select <option_id>"
		  - Select the device tree from the flash for loading in the bootloader the next time.
		    If the user wants to use this option its necessary to disable read FDT from EEPROM (by runnig "fdt_config off").
		    **Note: To select fdt from flash first run "fdt_config list" command.
			    Because the option_id is received from this list.

"fdt_config save" - Write Device Tree changes from RAM to EEPROM.

Example:
------
   i) Select one of dtb files in the U-Boot image to boot with next time.
      a) List all the dtb files in the U-Boot image.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config list
	 FDT config list:
	 1 - DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular
	 2 - DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular-SGMII1
      b) Select one of the dtb files to boot with next time.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config select 2
	 To save the changes, run the command fdt_config save.
      c) Save the configuration.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config save
      d) Reset and U-Boot starts with the selected dtb file.
	 Marvell>> reset
   ii) Load certain dtb files from U-Boot image into DRAM and modify it.
       Burn it into EEPROM and boot with it.
      a) Enable boot with dtb in EEPROM feature.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config on
	 Do you want to read FDT from EEPROM? <y/N> y
	 Load fdt from EEprom
	 To save the changes, run the command fdt_config save.
      b) List all the dtb files in the U-Boot image.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config list
	 FDT config list:
	 1 - DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular
	 2 - DB-88F3720-DDR3-Modular-SGMII1
      c) Load the dtb file into DRAM.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config read flash 2
	 To save the changes, run the command fdt_config save.
      d) Run "fdt print" command to see the entire dtb file in DRAM.
      e) Edit any property, for example, the preset value in the A3700 dts file.
         Following are all the valid values for the property "preset":
	 PRESET_CPU_600_DDR_600:  0
	 PRESET_CPU_400_DDR_600:  1
	 PRESET_CPU_1000_DDR_800: 2
	 PRESET_CPU_800_DDR_800:  3

	 Marvell>> fdt set /soc/freq preset "<1>"
      f) Save the dtb file into EEPROM.
	 Marvell>> fdt_config save
      g) Reset and U-Boot starts with the dtb file in the EEPROM.
	 Marvell>> reset
