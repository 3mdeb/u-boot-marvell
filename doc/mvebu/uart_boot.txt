UART boot
---------
For Armada-3700 please see the section "UART boot for Armada-3700 platform"
UART boot is used to load ATF image using XMODEM interface when the board boots for
the first time or the board fails to boot.

1. Set the board to receiving mode using either of the following methods:
	- Start a terminal application (e.g. minicom), and send the Xmodem_boot_pattern.bin file
	  (located under /tools/marvell/xmodem/xmodem_boot.pattern) in ASCII,
	  (for minicom do: Ctrl+A, then S, then select ASCII), and reset the board at the same time.
	- This option is only relevant for Marvell development boards:
	  Set the boot source to UART, using boot source DIP-switch pins, and then reset the board.
2. After booting from UART, or sending the pattern file, characters are displayed on the
   screen every second. These are the Xmodem NACKs that indicate readiness to send the
   new ATF with Xmodem protocol.
3. Start the TTY ATF transfer using Xmodem protocol
   (for minicom do: Ctrl/A, then S, and select the Xmodem protocol).
4. Select the ATF image file, and start transfer.
5. When transfer is done, U-Boot will start and you should hit <return> to get U-Boot prompt.
6. When ATF & U-Boot loads refer to doc/mvebu/commands/bubt.txt to burn ATF image.

UART boot for Armada-3700 platform
---------------------------------
1. The normal build procedure for A3700 target creates an archive
   with all the images required for UART boot. If these images are used,
   extract the uart-images.tgz archive into temporary folder and
   continue with below procedure starting paragraph 4.

2. Change the TIM/NTIM file descriptor to use the UART image type
   (for NTIM - tools/wtp/u-boot-ntim.txt).
   Replace the following row:

   Boot Flash Signature:          0x5350490A              ; Select SPI'0A

   With the following one:

   Boot Flash Signature:          0x55415223              ; Select UAR'23

3. Build the u-boot image as usual. Files with "_h." in their names
   are created for usage by the image downloader SW.

4. Make sure the target board is in UART mode and ">" prompt is
   presented on connected terminal. Pressing "Enter" in this mode
   will show "E" and then ">" again.

5. Stop the terminal emulator program on UART port attached to the
   target board (minicom) for releasing the serial port and allowing
   application to use it for image download.

6. Start the image download application in the root u-boot folder
   using the following parameters (replace UART port name with the one
   connected to actual target board).

   Linux downloader usage example:

   sudo WtpDownload_linux.exe -P UART -C /dev/ttyUSB0 -R 115200 \
   -B TIM_UBOOT_NON_TRUSTED.bin -I spl/u-boot-spl_h.bin \
   -I ./u-boot_h.bin  -I ./tools/wtp/wtmi_h.dummy -E

   Windows downloader usage example:

   The target board is connected to COM7 and all images are located in
   the same folder:

   WtpDownload.exe -P UART -C 7 -R 115200 -B TIM_UBOOT_NON_TRUSTED.bin
   -I u-boot-spl_h.bin -I u-boot_h.bin  -I wtmi_h.dummy -E

   It is possible to add "-V" parameter to the command line for
   enabling verbose output.

   Note that "-E" parameter can be dropped from the above commands.
   In such case after checking that the BootROM UART download mode is
   selected in paragraph 4, type in terminal "wtp" without quotes and
   press Enter. Then follow the procedure in paragraph 5.
   This command will switch BootROM to WTP download mode. The same is
   archived by "-E" parameter in latest downloader SW.

7. Once the process is finished, start the terminal emulator
   program (minicom) on the UART port attached to the target
   board and ensure the u-boot prompt is reached.
