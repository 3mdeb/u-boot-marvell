UART boot
---------
UART boot is used to load ATF image using XMODEM interface when the board boots for
the first time or the board fails to boot.

1. Set the board to receiving mode using either of the following methods:
	- Start a terminal application (e.g. minicom), and send the Xmodem_boot_pattern.bin file
	  (located under /tools/marvell/xmodem/xmodem_boot.pattern) in ASCII,
	  (for minicom do: Ctrl+A, then S, then select ASCII), and reset the board at the same time.
	- This option is only relevant for Marvell development boards:
	  Set the boot source to UART, using boot source DIP-switch pins, and then reset the board.
2. After booting from UART, or sending the pattern file, characters are displayed on the
   screen every second. These are the Xmodem NACKs that indicate readiness to send the
   new ATF with Xmodem protocol.
3. Start the TTY ATF transfer using Xmodem protocol
   (for minicom do: Ctrl/A, then S, and select the Xmodem protocol).
4. Select the ATF image file, and start transfer.
5. When transfer is done, U-Boot will start and you should hit <return> to get U-Boot prompt.
6. When ATF & U-Boot loads refer to doc/mvebu/commands/bubt.txt to burn ATF image.
