MVEBU GPIO DT bindings
-----------------------
Required properties:
- compatible:           Should be "marvell,mvebu-gpio"
- reg:                  The register base for the GPIO bank controller
- bank-name:            The gpio bank name
- ngpios:               gpio count in bank

Optional properties:
None


Examples:
Let's take Armada3700 as an example.
Armada3700 has two GPIO banks, one is north bridge GPIO bank and aother is south bridge GPIO bank.

	gpio0: gpio@13800 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-gpio";
		reg = <0x13800 0x800>;
		bank-name = "armada-3700-north-bridge";
		status = "disabled";
		ngpios = <64>;
	};
	gpio1: gpio@18800 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-gpio";
		reg = <0x18800 0x800>;
		bank-name = "armada-3700-south-bridge";
		status = "disabled";
		ngpios = <32>;
	};

When other nodes want to use a GPIO pin, they can call the marco ARMADA_3700_GPIO
which is defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/armada-3700-gpio.h>
For example, mmc1 can use the gpio1's 22nd pin for SDIO VCC setting as below.

mmc1: mmc@D0000 {
	sdio-vcc-gpio = <&gpio1 ARMADA_3700_GPIO(BANK_1, 22) GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	status = "okay";
};
