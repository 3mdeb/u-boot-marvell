Marvell SPI bindings
====================

The node name is spi0 to show that it's SPI-0, for SPI-1 should be spi1.

The SPI node requires the following properties:
	- compatible = "marvell,orion-spi";
	- reg = <0x510600 0x50>;
		base address of SPI-0
	- spi-max-frequency = <51200>;
		This property used to calculate the SPI max bus frequency.
		The value in Byte
	- clock = <&tclk>;
		This property points to the used clock for the SPI interface.
		in this example the node point to the t-clock.
	- cpol-cs-bitmap = <1>;
		This property is bitmap that defined if SCK idles high for chip-select i by enable bit i.
	- status = "okay";
		Set if the SPI interface is enabled/disabled

Example for SPI-0 node:
	spi0: spi@10600 {
		compatible = "marvell,orion-spi";
		reg = <0x10600 0x50>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <20971520>;
		clock = <&tclk>;
		status = "okay";
		cpol-cs-bitmap = <1>; /*bit i is set if the cs-i SCK idles high */
	};
