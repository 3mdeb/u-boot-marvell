Marvell EBU USB 3.0 bindings
====================

This USB 3.0 driver is based on mainline xHCI, and it supports Marvell EBU SoC,
which implements the xHCI core operations.

The USB 3.0 node requires the following properties:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,mvebu-usb3".
	- reg: the base address of the xHCI unit.

Example for USB 3.0 node:
	usb3: usb3@58000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-usb3";
		reg = <0x58000 0x450>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
