Marvell ArmadaLP UART bindings
====================

This UART driver supports Marvell ArmadaLP SoC, which implements the uart core operations.
The node name is serial0 to show that it's UART-0, for UART-1 should be serial1.

The armadaLP serial node requires the following properties:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,armadalp-uart"
	- reg: the base address of the UART unit
	- clock_frequency: input clock frequency of UART unit
	- baudrate: the baudrate of the UART unit

Example for armadaLP UART-0 node:
	serial: serial@12000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armadalp-uart";
		reg = <0x12000 0x20>;
		clock_frequency = <4800>;
		baudrate = <115200>;
		status = "okay";
	};
