Binding for marvell mvebu SCSI controller

Required properties:
- #address-cells  - the number of cells used to represent physical base addresses
- #size-cells     - the number of cells used to represent the size of an address
- compatible      - the name of mvebu SCSI bus controller, supported value "marvell,mvebu-scsi",
                    covers the following Marvell SoC families: armada3700, armada70x0 and armada80x0

Optional property:
- max-id          - maximum number of scsi target ids, the default value is CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_SCSI_ID
- max-lun         - maximum number of scsi logical units, the default value is CONFIG_SYS_SCSI_MAX_LUN

Example for armada3700 SCSI controller which is SAS and acts as an add-on host bus adapter without the
base register:
- Armada3700 has only 1 SATA interface, so the property "max-id" is 1;
- Armada3700 max logical units number is 1, so the property "max-lun" is 1.

	scsi: scsi {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-scsi";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		max-id = <1>;
		max-lun = <1>;
		sata: sata@e0000 {
			compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-ahci";
			reg = <0xe0000 0x2000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 27 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		};
	};
