Marvell COMPHY SerDes lane bindings
=====================================

The COMPHY node include description about the COMPHY SerDes lane configuration.
The comphy driver initialize the MUX of the SerDes lanes, and power up the serdes
by dependencies on the FDT blob configurations

The COMPHY node requires the following properties:
	- compatible:
		the compatible should include "marvell,mvebu-comphy"
		and the COMPHY per chip compatible:
		"marvell,comphy-armada38x" for Armada-38x
		the COMPHY per chip used to set which MUX configuration to use, and COMPHY power-up revision
	- reg-comphy: the base address of the COMPHY units
	- reg-hpipe3: the base address of the hpipe3 units
	- max-lanes: maximum number of comphy lanes
	- mux-bitcount: number of bits that allocated for every mux in the comphy-selector register
	- phy: entry that include the configuration of the phy
	  every phy should have the below parameters:
	  - phy-type: the PHY type (SGMII0/SATA1/PEX2...), the posible modes under include/dt-bindings/comphy/comphy_data.h
	  - phy-speed: the PHY speed (1G/1.5G...), the posible speeds under include/dt-bindings/comphy/comphy_data.h

Example:
	comphy {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-comphy", "marvell,comphy-armada38x";
		mux-bitcount = <4>;
		max-comphy = <6>;
		reg-comphy = <0x18300 0x100>;
		reg-hpipe3 = <0xa0000 0x800>;
		phy0 {
			phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_SATA0>;
			phy-speed = <PHY_SPEED_1_25G>;
		};
		phy1 {
			phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_PEX0>;
			phy-speed = <PHY_SPEED_5G>;
		};
		phy2 {
			phy-type = <PHY_TYPE_PEX1>;
			phy-speed = <PHY_SPEED_5G>;
		};
	};
