Marvell CCU address decoding bindings
=====================================

The CCU node include describtion about the address decoding configuration.

The CCU node requires the following properties:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,mvebu-ccu"
	- reg: the base address of the CCU unit
	- max-win: number of the max mbus windows
	- windows: entry that include the configuration of the windows
	  every window should have 4 parameters:
	  - high base address of the window
	  - low base address of the window
	  - size of the window
	  - target-id of the window

Note: if the base address is more than 32bit, it divided into high and low,
	Example:
		base address: 0x10f0000000 should divided into:
		base address high: 0x10
		base address low: 0xf0000000

Example:
	map-ccu {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-ccu";
		reg = <0x0 0x50>;
		max-win = <8>;
		windows = <0x0 0xf8000000 0x2000000 0x00 /* IO window */>;
	};
