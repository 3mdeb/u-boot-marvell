Marvell CCU address decoding bindings
=====================================

The CCU node includes descriptions of the address decoding configuration.

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,mvebu-ccu"
	- reg: the base address of the CCU unit
	- max-win: number of the max mbus windows
	- windows: entry that includes the configuration of the windows
	  every window has 5 parameters:
	  - high base address of the window
	  - low base address of the window
	  - high size of the window
	  - low size of the window
	  - target-id of the window

Note: if the base address is more than 32bits, it should be divided into high and low,
	the same applies to the size field, if it more that 32bits, it should be divided into high and low.
	Base example:
		base address: 0x10f0000000 should be divided into:
		base address high: 0x10
		base address low: 0xf0000000
	Size example:
		size: 0x1E00F00000 should divided into:
		size high: 0x1E
		size low: 0x00F00000

Example:
	map-ccu {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-ccu";
		reg = <0x0 0x50>;
		max-win = <8>;
		windows = <0x0 0xf8000000 0x0 0x2000000 0x00 /* IO window */>;
	};
