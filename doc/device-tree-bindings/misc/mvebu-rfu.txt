Marvell RFU address decoding bindings
=====================================

The RFU node include describtion about the address decoding configuration.
Transactions that are decoded by CCU windows as IO peripheral, have an additional
layer of decoding, this additional address decoding layer defines one of the
following targets:
	0x0 = BootRom
	0x1 = STM (Serial Trace Macro-cell, a programmerâ€™s port into trace stream)
	0x2 = SPI direct access
	0x3 = PCIe registers
	0x4 = IHB Port
	0x5 = PCIe port

The RFU node requires the following properties:
	- compatible: the compatible of the driver
	- reg: the base address of the RFU window
	- max-win: number of the max mbus windows
	- windows: entry that include the configuration of the windows
	  every window should have 3 parameters:
	  - base address of the window
	  - size of the window
	  - target-id of the window

Example:
	rfu {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-rfu";
		reg = <0x6f0000 0x50>;
		windows = <0xf2000000 0x40000000 0x05 /* PCIe window */
			0xf6000000 0x20000000 0x02 /* SPI window */>;
	};
