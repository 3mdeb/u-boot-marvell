Marvell EBU SATA bindings
====================

This SATA driver supports Marvell EBU SoC, which implements the SATA core operations.
The node name is sata0 to show that it's SATA-0, for SATA-1 should be sata1.

The SATA node requires the following properties:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,mvebu-sata".
	- reg: the base address of the SATA unit.

Example for SATA-0 node:
	sata: sata@e0000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-sata";
		reg = <0xe0000 0x20>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
