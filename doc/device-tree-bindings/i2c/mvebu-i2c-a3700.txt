Armada3700 I2C bindings
====================

The I2C driver provides read / write access to external peripherals
using the I2C bus.

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible
		Should be "marvell,armada-3700-i2c".
	- reg
		Base address and size of I2C.
	- status
		Set to okay/disabled if the I2C interface is enabled/disabled.

Example for I2C-0 node:
	i2c: i2c@11000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-i2c";

		reg = <0x11000 0x100>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
