Marvell ArmadaLP GBE bindings
====================

This GBE driver supports Marvell ArmadaLP SoC, which implements the GBE core operations.
The node name is neta0 to show that it's GBE-0, for GBE-1 should be neta1.

The GBE node for ArmadaLP requires the following properties:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,armadalp-neta".
	- reg: the base address of the GBE unit.
	- phy_addr: the phy address for the GBE interface.
	- phy_mode: the phy mode for the GBE interface, which should be one of the following:
		"mii",
		"gmii",
		"sgmii",
		"sgmii_2500",
		"qsgmii",
		"tbi",
		"rmii",
		"rgmii",
		"rgmii_id",
		"rgmii_rxid",
		"rgmii_txid",
		"rtbi",
		"xgmii",

Example for GBE-0 node:
	neta0: neta@30000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armadalp-neta";
		reg = <0x30000 0x20>;
		phy_addr = <0x0>;
		phy_mode = "rgmii";
		status = "disabled";
	};
