PXA3xx NAND DT bindings
=======================

Implementation of the NAND controller device driver for Marvell SoCs

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
- compatible:		Should be set to: marvell,mvebu-pxa3xx-nand
- reg:			Registers for the controller:
			0. reg base for the controller (mandatory, should be the first reg)
			1. reg offset for the flash clock (optional, should be called "flash_clock")
			2. reg offset for the device mux (optional, should be called "dev_mux")
- reg-names: 		Should contain the reg names (mandatory if using the optional regs)
			0. "ctrl_base": Should contain the ctrl base register address (the first reg)
			1. "flash_clock": Should contain the flash clock register address
			2. "dev_mux": Should contain the soc device mux register address
- clocks:		phandle to system controller clock driving this unit
- #address-cells:	Set to <1> if the node includes partitions

Optional properties:
SoC specific:
	- nand-enable-arbiter: Set to enable the bus arbiter
	- nand-keep-config:    Set to keep the NAND controller config as set by the bootrom.
Board specific:
	- nand-ecc-strength:   Number of bits to correct per ECC step
	- nand-ecc-step-size:  Number of data bytes covered by a single ECC step
	- num-cs:              Number of chipselect lines to use

The following ECC strength and step sizes are currently supported:
	- nand-ecc-strength = <1>, nand-ecc-step-size = <512>
	- nand-ecc-strength = <4>, nand-ecc-step-size = <512>
	- nand-ecc-strength = <8>, nand-ecc-step-size = <512>

Example:
	cpm_nand: nand@720000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-pxa3xx-nand";
		reg = <0x720000 0x100>, <0x440700 0x20>, <0x440208 0x20>;
		reg-names = "ctrl_base", "flash_clock", "dev_mux";
		#address-cells = <1>;

		clocks = <&cpm_syscon0 1 2>;
		nand-enable-arbiter;
		num-cs = <1>;
		nand-ecc-strength = <4>;
		nand-ecc-step-size = <512>;
	};
